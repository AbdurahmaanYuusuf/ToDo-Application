# ToDo-Application
This is a TO-DO Board & Cards application.

It works as follows:
* the board contains 3 columns: Tasks TO-DO, Tasks IN-PROGRESS, and Tasks DONE. 
* tasks to be performed are held in the TO-DO columns.
* tasks in progress are held in the IN-PROGRESS columns.
* already finished tasks are held in the DONE columns.

The application contains the following features:
1. Show Board: lists all the cards in the TODO, INPROGRESS, and DONE columns.
2. Add card: addes a new card to the board.
3. Remove card: removes a card from the board.
4. Move card: this moves a card from one column to another in the board.
